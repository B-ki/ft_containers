# ft_containers

42-Subject

Level : 4

Objectives : Code some STL containers : vector, stack, map and set

Requirements : We have to use std::allocator (thus I don't leave the possibility to use another allocator), we have to code also some others templates :
- std::iterator
- std::enable_if (this is C++11, we are forced to stick to C++98 but this aims to teach us the magic of SFINAE)
- etc.
